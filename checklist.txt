Netlify & Domain Checklist - RoyalGoaRide.com

1) Netlify Primary Domain
- Confirm Netlify's Site settings -> "Domain management" -> Primary domain is set to: royalgoaride.com (non-www)
- If primary is non-www, Netlify will automatically redirect www → primary (ON). Do NOT add a conflicting rule in `_redirects`.

2) HTTPS / SSL
- If using Cloudflare in front of Netlify: set SSL/TLS mode to "Full" or "Full (strict)". NEVER use "Flexible".
- If not using Cloudflare, Netlify provides HTTPS automatically. Do not add HTTP→HTTPS redirect rules in `_redirects` while debugging.

3) DNS records
- Ensure a single authoritative set of records:
  - Use Netlify's recommended A/ALIAS or CNAME setup per their docs
  - Remove duplicate A or CNAME records that point to both Netlify and Cloudflare or another host
  - If using Cloudflare, keep Cloudflare proxy (orange cloud) on only after verifying SSL settings

4) Netlify www redirect
- In Netlify, confirm "Redirect www to primary domain" is enabled (this is automatic if primary domain differs).
- If enabled, REMOVE any `_redirects` rules that also redirect www → non-www to avoid loops.

5) Debug steps (quick)
- 1) Temporarily replace `_redirects` with minimal file (we did that)
- 2) Clear browser cookies for the domain and open a fresh incognito window
- 3) Test both http://royalgoaride.com and http://www.royalgoaride.com and https variants
- 4) Check HTTP response headers with `curl -I -L https://royalgoaride.com` and `curl -I -L http://royalgoaride.com`
  Example:
  ```bash
  curl -I -L https://royalgoaride.com
  curl -I -L http://royalgoaride.com
  ```
- 5) Inspect Netlify deploy logs (Site -> Deploys -> Latest) for redirect/warnings

6) SEO-safe checks
- Ensure canonical tag points to your chosen canonical (https://royalgoaride.com/)
- Ensure sitemap uses the same canonical URLs (sitemap.xml currently uses https + non-www)
- Avoid internal meta-refresh or JS redirects for canonicalization (use 301 server redirects instead)
- After changes, re-run live tests (Chrome Incognito, curl, and https://httpstatus.io)

7) Rollback plan
- If anything breaks, re-upload `_redirects.bak` to `_redirects` and deploy to restore previous behavior while you debug.

---
Notes for Junior Dev:
- Don't add `!` (force) redirects (like `301!`) while debugging — they override Netlify and can create loops.

- Test with cleared cookies and incognito to avoid cached redirects.
